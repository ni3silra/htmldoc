# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an open-source JavaScript library that enables users to create architectural diagrams using an intuitive HTML-like syntax. The library will automatically arrange diagram elements using force-directed graph layouts, provide high-quality icons, and ensure cross-browser compatibility. Users will be able to define system components like microservices, API gateways, and databases through custom tags and attributes without requiring deep JavaScript or SVG knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define diagram elements using HTML-like syntax, so that I can create architectural diagrams without learning complex diagramming APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes custom HTML tags like `<microservice>`, `<api-gateway>`, `<database>` THEN the system SHALL recognize and parse these elements
2. WHEN a user adds attributes to elements (name, brand, connections) THEN the system SHALL extract and utilize these attributes for diagram generation
3. WHEN a user defines nested or connected elements THEN the system SHALL maintain the hierarchical and relational structure
4. IF an element uses an unsupported tag THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want diagrams to be automatically laid out using force-directed graphs, so that I don't need to manually position elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are parsed from HTML THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate optimal positions using force-directed algorithms
2. WHEN connections between elements are defined THEN the system SHALL visualize these relationships with clear lines or arrows
3. WHEN the diagram layout is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure no overlapping elements and readable spacing
4. WHEN elements are added or removed THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate layout transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want high-quality icons for diagram elements, so that my architectural diagrams look professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element type is rendered THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate high-quality icon
2. WHEN a required icon is missing from the library THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch it from external sources
3. IF an icon cannot be found THEN the system SHALL display a fallback icon or placeholder
4. WHEN icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent sizing and quality across all browsers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to work across all modern browsers, so that my users can view diagrams regardless of their browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is loaded in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the system SHALL render diagrams correctly
2. WHEN interactive features are used THEN the system SHALL respond consistently across all supported browsers
3. WHEN CSS styles are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across browsers
4. IF a browser lacks certain features THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate polyfills or graceful degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive diagram features, so that I can explore and understand the architectural relationships better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over an element THEN the system SHALL display tooltips with additional information
2. WHEN a user interacts with the diagram THEN the system SHALL provide smooth zooming and panning capabilities
3. WHEN elements change state THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly
4. WHEN a user clicks on elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback or actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this library, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of the HTML-like syntax
2. WHEN a developer needs examples THEN the system SHALL include sample code for different diagram types
3. WHEN a developer wants to customize the library THEN the system SHALL provide extension and customization instructions
4. WHEN a developer encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides and common solutions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to embed diagrams in documentation platforms like Confluence, so that I can include architectural diagrams directly in my team's documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is embedded in Confluence pages THEN the system SHALL render diagrams correctly within the page context
2. WHEN used in other documentation platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with common content management systems
3. WHEN embedded in restricted environments THEN the system SHALL work within typical security constraints of documentation platforms
4. WHEN the library loads in documentation contexts THEN the system SHALL not conflict with existing page styles or scripts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to handle large diagrams efficiently, so that performance remains acceptable even with complex architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diagram contains many elements (50+) THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
2. WHEN rendering complex layouts THEN the system SHALL complete initial render within 2 seconds
3. WHEN users interact with large diagrams THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animations and transitions
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide optimization options or warnings
